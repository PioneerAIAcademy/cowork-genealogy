"""Corpus-wide gate for the committed e2e fixtures.

The tree schema drifted into fiction because nothing automated ran it: 25
of 26 committed starting trees failed it, silently, until the fixture-
authoring work audited them by hand — and the agent was repairing broken
fixtures mid-run, burning the tokens the fixtures exist to measure. This
test is the "never again": every push that touches a fixture or a schema
(eval-harness-tests.yml already triggers on both paths) re-lints the whole
corpus, offline and deterministically.
