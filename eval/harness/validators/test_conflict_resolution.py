"""Skill-specific validators for the conflict-resolution skill.

conflict-resolution keeps its `rubric.md` — all three dimensions
(Source independence analysis, Evidence weighing, Resolution
completeness) are pure GPS craft and stay graded by the LLM judge.

These check structural invariants that should hold for every
conflict-resolution test, regardless of the specific test case, plus
tag-gated assertions on specific verdicts the test author wants
checked deterministically (e.g., "preferred_assertion_id was set to
one of a_002 / a_009").

See `validators/test_universal.py` module docstring for the full2
validator function-signature contract. Briefly: `before_state`,
`after_state`, `tool_calls`, `skill_frontmatter`, and `test` (the
parsed test JSON dict) are each separate parameters supplied by the
harness — pull the one you need by declaring it in your function
signature.

# to prevent drift between two sources of truth.


# --- Tool allowlist ---
#
# `test_no_mcp_tools_called` was removed: conflict-resolution declares
# `place_search` and `place_distance` in its allowed-tools (used for
# identity-conflict travel-distance analysis), and step 7 of SKILL.md
# invokes validate-schema as a sub-skill — which after the TypeScript
# validator port calls `validate_research_schema`. The universal
# `test_tool_allowlist` (in test_universal.py) already enforces the
# real invariant: every call must match the skill's declared
# allowed-tools (with sub-skill calls handled correctly).
