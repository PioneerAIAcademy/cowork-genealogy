```
research_append({ projectPath, section, op, entry | entryId + fields }) -> compact summary
research_append({ projectPath, ops, sourceDescription? })              -> compact summary (composite)
```

One tool with a `section` + `op` discriminator. The LLM supplies the analytical
content (the assertion's value, the conflict's weighing, the question text); the
tool assigns the section's id, enforces the schema and the cross-field invariants,
preserves the supersede-not-delete rule structurally, and does the validate-before-
persist atomic write.

> **Rev. 2 (2026-07-11, record-extraction consolidation D1/D2):** the batch form
> gained the **composite persist** — `sourceDescription` creates the tree
> `S` entry in the same call (§3.4), sources appends must reference a real `S`
> (§3.4), assertion `source_id` is auto-stamped (§3.4), the persona/record-id
> matrix is enforced against the log entry's sidecar (§3.5), `standard_place` is

## 1. Why this exists

Per `research-schema-spec.md:143`: *"Append-only sections (`log`) are never
rewritten. All other sections allow field updates but skills must preserve IDs and
never delete entries — supersede with a status field instead."* Today every one of
those "all other sections" is written **by hand** across ~8 skills, each ending in
the re-serialize-and-revalidate loop this tool direction exists to kill:

- **Id allocation by hand** — every section uses a prefix + next-number id
  (`src_`, `a_`, `pe_`, `q_`, `pl_`, `pli_`, `c_`, `h_`, `t_`, `kh_`); the LLM
  computes "next available" and can collide or skip.
- **Supersede-not-delete is prose, not structure** — `person_evidence` revision
  sets `superseded_by` on the old entry (`research-schema-spec.md:431`); a stray
  delete breaks the audit trail. Only a tool can make it structural.
- **Cross-field invariants are prose the LLM must remember** — and the validator
  already hard-fails on them after the fact: `exhaustive_declaration` requires
  `log_entry_ids` non-empty and `stop_criteria` non-null when `declared`
  (`validator.ts:417–424`); a fact conflict needs ≥2 `competing_assertion_ids`,
  identity ≥1 (`validator.ts:607–611`); a `ruled_out` hypothesis needs
  `ruled_out_reason` (`validator.ts:637–638`). Enforcing these *before* the write
  turns "validation failure, fix, re-serialize" into "rejected with a clear error,
  nothing written."
- **Multi-entry / multi-file writes re-serialize large JSON** — `record-extraction`
  writes a source + many assertions and is told to "write first persona, then
  Edit-append the rest" — the same large-JSON failure mode the log tool removed.

## 2. Evidence base (seen directly)

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| Section ownership + mutability table ("Mutable; never delete, supersede with status") | `docs/specs/research-schema-spec.md:131–143` |
| Only `log` is append-only; all other sections allow field updates, preserve ids, never delete | `research-schema-spec.md:134, 143, 291` |
| `person_evidence` revision sets `superseded_by`, never deletes | `research-schema-spec.md:427, 431` |
| `plans`: re-plan creates a new plan, old one set `superseded`; search skills update only `items[].status` | `research-schema-spec.md:133, 265` |
| id prefixes per section | `src/validation/validator.ts` `ID_PREFIXES` (`src_/a_/pe_/q_/pl_/pli_/c_/h_/t_/kh_`) |
| Coupling invariants already validated post-hoc | `validator.ts:417–424` (exhaustive_declaration), `:607–611` (conflict), `:637–638` (hypothesis) |
| The shipped append template: id/timestamp assignment, validate-before-persist, atomic write, compact return, camelCase→snake_case | `src/tools/research-log-append.ts`, `research-log-editor-spec.md` |
| Shared write layer | `src/utils/project-io.ts` (`atomicWriteJson`), `src/validation/validator.ts` (`validateParsed`) |

## 3. The tool

```typescript
research_append({
  projectPath: string,
  section:
    | "sources" | "assertions" | "person_evidence"
    | "questions" | "plans" | "plan_items"
    | "conflicts" | "hypotheses" | "known_holdings" | "timelines"
    | "proof_summaries" | "evaluations" | "project",   // project: update-only singleton, §3.1
  op: "append" | "update",

  // op = "append": a new entry WITHOUT its id (the tool assigns the prefix id).
  entry?: object,

  // op = "update": target an existing entry by id and supply the fields to change.
  entryId?: string,          // e.g. "c_003" — must match `section`'s prefix
  fields?: object,           // shallow-merged onto the existing entry; ids immutable

  // plan_items append/update target their parent plan:
  planId?: string,           // required for section = "plan_items"

  // Composite persist (§3.4): create the tree.gedcomx.json S entry for this
  // call's single sources append op and stamp its gedcomx_source_description_id.
  sourceDescription?: { title: string, author?: string, url?: string },

  // Composite persist (§3.4.2): the structured verdict body for an
  // `evaluations` append. The tool writes it to
  // evaluations/<focus>-<target_id>-<short_iso>.json and stamps the entry's
  // file_path. Rejected alongside an explicit file_path, or on any other section.
  verdict?: Record<string, unknown>,

  // §3.6: default true — resolve standard_place for assertion appends that
  // carry a `place` but omit `standard_place` (sidecar copy first, then
  // geocoding). false skips only the geocoding lookup.
  resolveStandardPlace?: boolean,
})
```

camelCase at the boundary; the entry/fields are already the snake_case persisted
shape (the skill writes simplified project JSON directly). The tool renames any
camelCase convenience fields the same way `research_log_append` does.

### 3.1 Semantics

- **`append`** — assign the next `<prefix>NNN` id above the section's current max
  (max + 1, never count + 1), set any tool-owned timestamps (`created`), append to
  the section array (or, for `plan_items`, to `plans[planId].items`), validate,
  persist. Returns the assigned id.
- **`update`** — locate the entry by `entryId`, shallow-merge `fields`, **preserving
  the id and never removing the entry**. A status transition (e.g. a plan →
  `superseded`, a question → `resolved`) is an `update`. There is **no delete op** —
  the supersede-not-delete rule is structural (`research-schema-spec.md:143`).
- **`update` on the `project` singleton** — `project` is one object, not a list, so
  it has no id and no `append`: `op:"update"` shallow-merges `fields` (restricted to
  `allowedFields: ["status"]`) onto `research.project`, and the tool stamps
  `project.updated` (iso_date). `proof-conclusion` Step 8 uses this to set
  `project.status: "completed"`. The return's `entryId` echoes the section name
  (`"project"`). Making another field settable later = extend `allowedFields`.

### 3.2 Return value (compact — never echoes the section)

```typescript
{
  ok: true,
  section: string,
  op: "append" | "update",
  entryId: string,                 // assigned (append) or echoed (update)
  sourceDescriptionId?: string,    // the S id, when sourceDescription created one (§3.4)
  sourceReuse?: {                  // §3.4.1 — echoed whenever reuse detection engaged
    action: "created" | "updated_existing" | "new_source_reused_s",
    srcId: string,                 // the research source written (existing or newly assigned)
    sId: string | null,            // the tree S entry the source cites
  },
  resolvedPlaces?: [{ place, standardPlace, source: "sidecar" | "geocoded" }], // §3.6
  filesWritten: ["research.json"], // + "tree.gedcomx.json" first, when §3.4 wrote the S entry
  validation: { valid: true, warnings: string[] },
}
// on failure: { ok: false, errors: string[] } — nothing written
```

### 3.3 Batch form (`ops`) — persist a whole record in one call

To persist many entries at once (e.g. a record's source + every assertion + its
person-evidence links), pass an optional `ops` array instead of the top-level
`section`/`op`/`entry`/`entryId`/`fields`/`planId` (which are ignored when `ops`
is present). Each op is the same per-op shape the single form takes:

```typescript
research_append({
  projectPath,
  sourceDescription: { title: "1850 U.S. Federal Census" },       // §3.4 — creates the tree S entry
  ops: [
    { section: "sources",         op: "append", entry: {...} },
    { section: "assertions",      op: "append", entry: {...} },   // one op per assertion/persona
    { section: "person_evidence", op: "append", entry: {...} },   // one op per link
    { section: "assertions",      op: "update", entryId: "a_012", fields: {...} },
    { section: "plan_items",      op: "append", entry: {...}, planId: "pl_001" },
  ],
})
// → { ok: true, results: [{ section, op, entryId }, ...], sourceDescriptionId?,
//     resolvedPlaces?, filesWritten, validation }
// on failure: { ok: false, errors: ["ops[<i>]: <msg>"], opsReceived: N } — nothing written
```

Semantics — heterogeneous ops chosen over a homogeneous `entries` array because the
skills' natural unit of work (one record / household / plan) spans multiple sections,
and the single-call form already dispatches per-op on `section`, so heterogeneity is
no more expensive (decision from the e2e research-runtime speedup review, §6 Q1):

- **All-or-nothing.** Every op is applied to one in-memory `research`, the **whole
  document is validated once**, and `research.json` is written **once**. Any op's
  precondition failure (§5) or a final validation failure writes **nothing** and
  returns `{ ok: false, errors }`.
- **Per-op error indexing + `opsReceived`.** A precondition failure on op *i* (an
  `applyOne` check — bad section, missing field, the §5 invariants enforced in-loop —
  or a §3.4/§3.5/§3.6 pre-pass check, which collects **every** failing op at once)
  returns its message(s) prefixed `ops[<i>]: …`, so the caller can fix exactly the
  named rows and resubmit the identical batch otherwise. A failure caught only by
  the **final whole-document validation** is mapped back to the op that touched the
  offending entry when possible (`ops[<i>]: research.json/…`), and keeps its bare
  `research.json/…` path when no op in the batch touched it. Every batch failure
  additionally echoes `opsReceived: N` — the number of ops the tool received — so a
  retry that silently dropped ops (or a transport-side truncation) is detectable by
  comparing against the batch the caller believes it sent.
- **Intra-batch id assignment.** Ids are assigned in array order, each scanning the
  live in-memory document, so consecutive appends to a section get consecutive ids.
  A later op **may reference an id created by an earlier op** via that id's
  predictable `<prefix>NNN` (e.g. append the source as op #1, then an assertion op
  carries `source_id: "src_001"`). A later op **may NOT `update`** an id created
  earlier in the same batch — `append` assigns the id internally, so it cannot be
  named for an in-batch update; do that update in a follow-up call.
- **No-op ops** (e.g. re-declaring an already-exhaustive question) do not mutate; a
  batch of only no-ops writes nothing (`filesWritten: []`). `results` still echoes a
  row for every op (no-ops included), and any per-op no-op note is surfaced in
  `validation.warnings`; the `results` rows do not themselves flag which op was a no-op.
- **Section invariants (§5) hold across the batch** — e.g. two `append`s of an active
  plan for the same question in one batch are rejected at the second op, because the
  first is already in the live `research.plans` when the second's invariant runs.

The **persisted shape is byte-identical** to the single-op form; `ops` changes only
the number of write calls, so no `research.json` schema, validator, web-mirror, or
fixture change is required (the reason batching is low-risk).

**Stringified-argument tolerance.** The model occasionally serializes a large or
deeply nested argument as a JSON **string** rather than inline JSON — the ~25 KB
`ops` batch of a full record is exactly the size that triggers it. Because the input
schema declares `ops` as an array and `entry`/`fields` as objects, a string value is
unambiguously a mis-serialization. The tool therefore JSON-parses a string-valued
`ops`/`entry`/`fields` before any shape check (`src/utils/coerce-json-arg.ts`); an
unparseable string falls through to the normal, specific error (e.g. ``` `ops` must
be a non-empty array ```). This is not a supported call form — callers should still
pass real JSON — but it stops a correct-but-stringified batch from being rejected and
driving the model into a slow one-op-per-call fallback (the root cause of the
`record-extraction` eval wall-clock timeouts, 2026-06-30). `tree_edit` applies the
same tolerance to its `ops` and single-op nested objects (and to
`sourceDescription` here).

### 3.4 Composite persist (`sourceDescription`) — D1

The record-extraction unit of work is one record = one tree `S` entry + one
research source + N assertions. The composite makes that ONE call — the tool, not
the model, owns every id and every cross-file link (decision D1 of the
record-extraction consolidation; see
`docs/plan/record-extraction-consolidation-closing-report.md`).

- **`sourceDescription: { title, author?, url? }`** (camelCase param; the payload
  keys are exactly the simplified-GedcomX `S`-entry fields). When present, the call
  must contain **exactly one** `sources` append op. The tool allocates the next `S`
  id via the shared allocator (`utils/gedcomx-ids.ts` `nextId` — the same one
  `tree_edit` and the merge core use), appends the `S` entry to the in-memory tree,
  and **stamps the sources op's `gedcomx_source_description_id` itself**. The
  assigned id is echoed as `sourceDescriptionId`. Unknown keys, a missing/empty
  `title`, zero or 2+ sources append ops, or a sources op that *also* carries its
  own `gedcomx_source_description_id` are all rejected (use one mechanism, never
  both).
- **Reuse-or-create precondition.** Every `sources` append op must EITHER be the
  one `sourceDescription` stamps OR carry a `gedcomx_source_description_id` that
  already exists in `tree.gedcomx.json` — the multi-repository reuse pattern
  (`research-schema-spec.md` §"Multiple research sources can reference the same
  `gedcomx_source_description_id`", and the credited tree-source dedup). A
  dangling/predicted `S` is rejected **as a research_append precondition with an
  op-indexed, actionable error** ("pass `sourceDescription` to create it, or
  reference an existing S id") — deliberately NOT a new rule in the shared document
  validator, which is op-blind and would fail existing valid projects. (The
  validator's existing cross-file dangling-ref check remains the backstop.)
- **`source_id` auto-stamp.** When a call contains exactly one `sources` append op,
  every `assertions` append op that omits `source_id` (absent or null) is stamped
  with that source's assigned id — computed deterministically before the apply
  loop, no placeholder syntax, no model-side `src_NNN` prediction. An explicitly
  supplied `source_id` always wins (rare multi-source batches). Calls with zero or
  2+ sources append ops auto-stamp nothing: assertion `source_id` requirements are
  exactly as before.
- **Scope: `S` entry only, never tree facts.** The composite's tree write is
  limited to the source-description `S` entry — `research_append` **owns S-entry
  creation** but never writes person facts, names, or relationships into
  `tree.gedcomx.json`. Evidence facts materialize onto tree persons separately, at
  identity-link time, via **`materialize_facts`** (the fact writer), which reads
  the assertions this call persisted and stamps each fact with a provenance ref
  that resolves through the `S` id created here. See `research-schema-spec.md` §8,
  "tree.gedcomx.json update timing" (the two-layer rule).

### 3.4.1 Source-reuse auto-detection

The reuse decision used to live in the caller's head: the record-extractor
agent read `research.json` up front, matched the record against existing
sources, and chose between append/update/S-reuse by prose rule. That read is
exactly the per-delegation project-file re-read the extractor state diet
removes, so the decision moves into the tool — which already holds both
documents in memory at this point.

**When it engages.** All of: the call is a batch (`ops`); the batch contains
**exactly one** `sources` append op; that op does **not** carry an explicit
`gedcomx_source_description_id` (a caller-supplied id keeps today's verified-
reuse semantics, §3.4 — detection is bypassed and no `sourceReuse` is echoed);
and the batch contains at least one `assertions` append op with a non-empty
`record_id`. Batches with zero or 2+ sources append ops, single-op calls, and
sources-only batches are untouched.

**Matching.** The batch's distinct assertion `record_id`s are canonicalized
via `arkToBareId` (the same ARK normalization §3.5 uses, so resolver-URL,
bare-ARK, and type-prefixed forms of one record compare equal; non-ARK ids —
`ancestry:…`, `capture:…` — compare verbatim). Existing assertions in
`research.assertions` whose canonicalized `record_id` matches any of them name
the **matched sources** (via their `source_id`), kept in `research.sources`
array order. Repositories compare by normalized exact match (trim +
casefold).

**Decision (deterministic, first match wins):**

1. **Same repository** — a matched source whose normalized `repository`
   equals the sources op's → the append is **converted to an update** of that
   `src_` (the provided source fields shallow-merged onto it; the existing
   `gedcomx_source_description_id` is kept), every assertions append op that
   omits `source_id` is stamped with the existing `src_` id, and **no `S` is
   created** — a supplied `sourceDescription` is ignored (not validated).
   Echo: `action: "updated_existing"`.
2. **Different repository** — matched sources exist but none share the
   repository → the new `src_` is created as asked, but its
   `gedcomx_source_description_id` is stamped from the **first** matched
   source (sources-array order) and the `S`-create is skipped even when
   `sourceDescription` was supplied (ignored, not validated). Echo:
   `action: "new_source_reused_s"`. (Fallback: a legacy matched source with
   no `S` id falls through to path 3.)
3. **No matched source** — current §3.4 behavior (create the `S` via
   `sourceDescription`). Echo: `action: "created"`.

`sourceReuse.srcId` is the research source the batch wrote (the existing id
for path 1; the deterministic next `src_NNN` for paths 2–3), `sourceReuse.sId`
the tree `S` entry it cites. In paths 1–2 nothing touches the tree, so the
call is a research-only write (`filesWritten: ["research.json"]`, no
`sourceDescriptionId`). The §3.4 reuse-or-create precondition still backstops
path 2: a stamped `S` id must exist in the tree or the batch is rejected
op-indexed.

### 3.4.2 Composite persist (`verdict`) — evaluations sidecar

`evaluations[].file_path` is the same design as `log[].results_ref`: research.json
holds a pointer, and the payload lives in a sidecar only the host writes
(`results-staging.ts` is the precedent). The verdict body is large, structured, and
would bloat every whole-file read of research.json — which is exactly what the
orchestrator state diet is trying to shrink — so it does not go inline the way
`proof_summaries.narrative_markdown` does.

On an `evaluations` append carrying a top-level `verdict`, the tool:

1. derives `evaluations/<focus>-<target_id>-<short_iso>.json` from the entry's
   `focus`, `target_id` and `timestamp` (colons replaced for filesystem safety),
2. stamps that path onto the entry as `file_path`,
3. writes the sidecar **after** whole-document validation passes and **before** the
   research.json commit, creating `evaluations/` as needed.

Ordering matters in both directions: a rejected call leaves no orphan verdict file,
and a persisted pointer never names a file that does not exist. Doing it in one call
is what makes a dangling `file_path` structurally impossible rather than merely
unlikely — the failure mode the agent-writes-it-itself design could not rule out.

Rejected: `verdict` together with an explicit `entry.file_path` (ambiguous
ownership), `verdict` on any section other than `evaluations`, `verdict` spanning
more than one evaluations append in a batch, and an entry missing the `focus` /
`target_id` the filename is derived from.

The consumer is the `gps-mentor` agent, which holds no filesystem write tool; see
`docs/specs/gps-mentor-agent-spec.md` §8.

### 3.5 Persona/record-id enforcement matrix — D2

For every `assertions` append op whose `log_entry_id` resolves to a log entry, the
tool enforces the sidecar matrix (spec'd, not vibes — decision D2):

| Log entry state | `record_persona_id` supplied | `record_persona_id` omitted/null |
|---|---|---|
| **Sidecar present** (`results_ref` set), `record_id` matches a result (canonical ARK matching via `arkToBareId`) | Verified against the record's `gedcomx.persons[]`; a contradiction is a **hard error naming the expected persona ids** (and the primary persona). | **Auto-filled** with the matched result's `primaryId` when the `record_id` matches exactly one result, that `primaryId` resolves to a persona in the record's `gedcomx.persons[]`, **and the stamp cannot be wrong**: the record holds a single persona, or the batch's assertion appends all cite one canonical `record_id` **and** one distinct `record_role` (a single-focus extraction — sidecar personas carry no role labels, so batch shape is the only sound proxy for "this assertion is about the searched persona"). A multi-persona record in a batch spanning multiple `record_role`s/`record_id`s is a **hard error naming the searched persona** ("supply `record_persona_id` per assertion") — unscoped auto-fill stamped the focus persona's id onto other household members' assertions (observed silent corruption). A degenerate sidecar whose `primaryId` is missing/unresolvable leaves the field null rather than persisting a value the validator would reject. |
| **Sidecar present**, `record_id` matches **no** result | **Hard error naming the sidecar's stored recordIds** — a claimed persona cannot be verified against a record that isn't there. | No error — a `record_id` outside the sidecar is legal without a persona claim (e.g. a negative assertion naming the collection searched). |
| **No sidecar** (`results_ref: null` — record_read, PDF, image, pasted records, most unit fixtures) | **Hard error**: the field must be absent or null; there is no persona document to point at. | No error. |

Additionally, when the `record_id` matches a sidecar result, it is
**canonicalized to the sidecar's stored form** (the result's `recordId`) before
persisting — resolver URLs, bare ARKs, type-prefixed and bare entity ids that
denote the same record all persist identically, killing the record-id form
divergence theme. A dangling `log_entry_id`, an unreadable sidecar, or a
traversal-escaping `results_ref` skip this enforcement (the document validator
already reports those). Ops without a `log_entry_id` are untouched here.

### 3.6 `standard_place` levers — resolution, echo, country guard

Two prevention levers for the silent-wrong-geocode theme, applied per `assertions`
append op (deliberately simple):

- **Lever B — sidecar copy first, never re-geocode what the record resolved.**
  When the op carries a `place` but omits `standard_place` (**strictly absent**;
  `standard_place: null` is an explicit per-entry opt-out that skips resolution
  and the guard):
  1. if the op's sidecar-matched record (§3.5) has a fact whose `place` equals the
     op's place string (trimmed, case-insensitive), its converter-resolved
     `standard_place` is **copied** — no geocoding call;
  2. otherwise (and unless `resolveStandardPlace: false`), the tool geocodes via
     the shared `resolveStandardPlace` — best-effort, a miss leaves the field
     unset with a warning, never fails the op.

  Every value the tool resolved is echoed in the success response's
  `resolvedPlaces: [{ place, standardPlace, source: "sidecar" | "geocoded" }]`
  so the caller can sanity-check geocoding without re-reading files.
- **Lever A — country-contradiction guard.** On the op's final
  `place`/`standard_place` pair (supplied or resolved): when the place TEXT's
  trailing comma-token names a recognized country (a small alias table:
  US/UK/constituent-country aliases plus the common genealogy countries) and the
  standard place's segments plainly lack it, the op is **rejected** with an
  actionable error (re-resolve, supply the correct value, or opt out with
  `standard_place: null`) — e.g. "West Bromwich, England" resolving to a
  standard_place ending in "Cameroon". UK constituents are consistent with
  "United Kingdom" (but not with a *different* constituent), and "Ireland" with
  "Northern Ireland" (historic records). When the place text names no country the
  guard cannot compare, so a **geocoded** value instead gets a
  verify-this warning (supplied and sidecar-copied values stay silent — the echo
  is their audit surface).

### 3.7 Boundary shape normalization (dates + labels)

Applied to every appended/updated entry before validation — lossless shape
normalization that keeps a well-formed extraction from being rejected, or from
splintering into inconsistent labels, over a form the model added:

- **`date` / `standard_date` object-unwrap.** The model routinely emits a
  GedcomX-style `{ original, formal }` object where the schema requires a plain
  string; the tool unwraps it to `original` (else `formal`). A string/null value,
  or an object without a usable string, passes through untouched.
- **`access_date` → ISO.** A source's `access_date` must be ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, but
  the model routinely supplies a human form (`"12 July 2026"`, `"July 12, 2026"`).
  The tool rewrites a parseable human date to ISO, reusing the genealogical
  `stdDate` standardizer (i18n month names, comma forms, dashed forms) plus a
  month-name→number map; the parse only accepts an unambiguous `DD Mon YYYY` /
  `Month DD, YYYY` (a form without a day, or an ambiguous numeric form, does
  **not** normalize). An already-ISO value is untouched; an unparseable value is
  left in place so the joint validator reports the real problem rather than the
  tool inventing a date. (Sources are the only section carrying `access_date`.)
- **`fact_type` canonicalization (assertions).** `fact_type` is an OPEN enum
  (`fact_type_recommended`), so the model freely varies casing (`Name`,
  `CauseOfDeath`) and reaches for role-prefixed or bare-structure aliases
  (`father_name`, `parentage`) — the same logical fact then reads as several
  distinct labels downstream. The tool reduces the value to a normalized key
  (lowercase, non-alphanumerics stripped, so `Cause of Death`/`cause_of_death`/
  `CauseOfDeath` all collapse to one key) and maps a **recognized** alias to its
  canonical spelling (`father_name`/`mother_name` → `name`, `parentage` →
  `relationship`, `CauseOfDeath` → `cause_of_death`, …). This is a best-effort
  **translator, not a closed allow-list**: a value whose normalized key is
  unrecognized passes through **unchanged** (an unrecognized fact type stays
  legal, just un-normalized). `sex`/`gender` stay distinct — a genuine content
  mislabel is surfaced, not silently "corrected". (Only assertions carry
  `fact_type`, so this is a no-op for every other section.)
- **Event place/date fold into the event fact (assertions).** An event's place
  and date are **attributes** of the one event fact, not their own types
  (matching the tree + GedcomX, which have no `Birthplace`/`Deathplace` type —
  birthplace is the `place` of a `Birth` fact). So a place-of-event variant
  (`birthplace`, `place_of_birth`, `deathplace`, `burialplace`, …) is folded to
  the event type (`birthplace` → `birth`, `deathplace` → `death`), **and** the
  tool lifts the place value into the machine-readable `place` field when neither
  `place` nor `standard_place` is already set (the human `value` of a place-claim
  *is* the place string, e.g. `"Ireland"`). This keeps a birthplace-claim and a
  birth-date claim independently classifiable as two `birth` assertions — the
  census case where a stated birthplace is `direct` while the computed birth year
  is `indirect` — distinguished by field population (`place` set = the
  place-claim, `date` set = the date-claim) rather than by the type name.

## 4. Persistence — validate-before-persist, atomic

Mirrors `research_log_append` minus the sidecar:

1. Read `research.json` and `tree.gedcomx.json` (healing legacy tree shapes in
   memory via `sanitizeTree`, for the cross-file checks `validateParsed` runs).
2. Run the composite/enforcement pre-pass (§3.4–§3.6) — S-entry creation and
   stamps on the in-memory documents, all op-scoped precondition errors collected.
3. Apply the `append`/`update` ops in memory — id assignment, field merge,
   tool-owned timestamps.
4. **Enforce the section invariants (§5) as preconditions.** A violation returns
   `{ ok: false, errors }` and writes nothing — the same verdict the validator
   would give, but *before* the write.
5. **Validate once** with `validateParsed(research, tree, { projectPath })` — the
   joint validation covers both in-memory documents, including a §3.4 `S` entry.
   If invalid → write nothing (the in-memory tree mutation is discarded too).
6. Commit:
   - **No tree mutation** (every call without `sourceDescription`): write only
     `research.json` with `atomicWriteJson`. No `.bak` (this section, unlike the
     irreversible merges, is append/supersede with full history-in-file — the GPS
     audit trail is the recovery mechanism; consistent with `research_log_append`).
   - **Composite (§3.4) tree mutation:** back up `tree.gedcomx.json` →
     `tree.gedcomx.json.bak` (the same one-deep user-recovery semantics every tree
     writer has — NOT a rollback mechanism), then commit **both files with
     `atomicWriteBoth`, tree first, research second** (the same both-or-neither
     write shape and ordering the merge tools use; a crash between the two renames
     leaves a new tree + old research — an unreferenced `S` entry, which is valid —
     with validate-on-next-open as the backstop). `filesWritten` lists the files in
     commit order. The healed (sanitized) tree is what persists, as with any tree
     writer.

---

## 5. State-coupling invariants enforced as preconditions

These are today prose rules repeated across skills (some 3×) precisely because they
are easy to violate by hand. As tool preconditions they become structural (the
audit's recommendation #5):

| Section / op | Invariant (reject if violated) | Source |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------|
| `conflicts` append (fact) | ≥2 `competing_assertion_ids`; identity ≥1 | `validator.ts:607–611` |
| `conflicts` update → `resolved` | `independence_analysis`, `weighing_analysis`, `resolution_rationale` all set; `preferred_assertion_id` ∈ `competing_assertion_ids` | audit; `validator.ts` NULLABLE set |
| `hypotheses` update → `ruled_out`/`status: ruled_out` | `ruled_out_reason` non-empty | `validator.ts:637–638` |
| `questions` update → `exhaustive_declared` | `exhaustive_declaration.declared` true ⇒ `log_entry_ids` non-empty and `stop_criteria` non-null; a re-declare on an already-declared question is a **no-op short-circuit** (don't overwrite a settled GPS Component-1 record) | `validator.ts:417–424` + audit |
| `plans` append | at most **one active plan per question** — a second `active` plan for the same `question_id` is rejected | audit; `research-schema-spec.md:265` |
| `person_evidence` revision | revision is an `append` of the new entry **plus** an `update` setting `superseded_by` on the old one; never a field-overwrite-in-place that loses the prior link | `research-schema-spec.md:427–431` |
| `person_evidence` append/update → `confident` | rejected when the linked assertion's `value` carries an uncertain reading (`[?]`) **and** no other live `person_evidence` row ties that `person_id` to a distinct record. Conjunctive on purpose: a `confident` link off a single *clean* record is the ordinary case and stays legal | audit theme 8; `record-extractor.md` epistemic cap |
| any section | `entry` for `append` must NOT carry an `id`; `update` must NOT change the `id` or the entry's prefix | `research-schema-spec.md:101` |

The LLM still makes every substantive decision and supplies the fields — the tool
only refuses to persist a structurally incoherent combination.

---

## 6. Decisions recorded

- **One tool with `section` + `op`, not per-section tools.** Same rationale as
  `tree_edit` and the repo's "generic tools with parameters, not one per endpoint"
  rule: all sections share the read → apply → enforce → validate → write pipeline;
  only the id prefix, field shape, and invariant set differ, and those are data
  (a per-section table), not separate code paths. *Rejected:* `append_assertion`,
  `append_conflict`, … (10+ near-identical tools).
- **`append` + `update`, no `delete`.** The schema forbids deletion outside `log`'s
  append-only model; supersede-via-status is the only "removal." Encoding that as
  "there is no delete op" makes the rule unbreakable.
- **Name kept as `research_append`** despite also doing `update`, to match the
  established reference in the project memory and `research-log-editor-spec.md:268`.
  The `op` discriminator carries the append-vs-update distinction; rename to
  `research_write` is a cosmetic option for the implementor.
- **Field shapes are referenced, not re-specified.** `research-schema-spec.md` §5 is
  the source of truth for each section's required fields, enums, and id prefix
  (and `validator.ts` is its executable form). This spec defines the tool's
  *mechanical contract* and the *invariants*, not a second copy of the field tables —
  the same "trust the existing source of truth" stance the merge spec takes toward
  the shipped core.

---

## 7. Scope & phasing

**In scope:** the mutable `research.json` sections listed in §3 (the
`research-schema-spec.md:131–143` ownership table minus `log`).

**Suggested phase 1** (highest frequency, unblocks the most skill rewrites):
`sources`, `assertions`, `person_evidence` (the `record-extraction` /
`person-evidence` write paths — the multi-entry
re-serialize hazard). **Phase 2:** `questions`, `plans`/`plan_items`, `conflicts`,
`hypotheses` (the status-transition + invariant sections). **Phase 3 / deferred:**
`timelines` (its *build* — supersede-filter + chronological sort + gap/impossibility
analysis — is a richer "timeline-build" operation the audit flagged separately; the
plain entry write fits here, the computed build may warrant its own tool),
`proof_summaries`, `evaluations`, and `project`/`researcher_profile` skeleton
(written once by `init-project`).

**Out of scope:** `log[]` + sidecars (shipped: `research_log_append`);
`tree.gedcomx.json` (the merge tools + `tree_edit`, `tree-edit-tool-spec.md`).

---

## 8. Errors / edge cases

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `projectPath` missing/invalid `research.json` or `tree.gedcomx.json` | input error; write nothing |
| `op: append` with an `entry` that carries an `id` | input error (the tool assigns ids) |
| `op: update` with an `entryId` not found in `section` (or wrong prefix) | staleness error; write nothing |
| `op: update` `fields` attempting to change `id` | input error |
| `section: plan_items` without a resolvable `planId` | input error |
| A §5 invariant violated | input error with the specific rule; write nothing |
| `sourceDescription` malformed (missing `title`, unknown keys) or without exactly one sources append op | input error; write nothing |
| sources append with neither `sourceDescription` nor an existing `gedcomx_source_description_id` (or with both) | op-indexed input error; write nothing |
| sources append referencing a dangling `S` id | op-indexed precondition error naming the existing S ids; write nothing |
| `record_persona_id` supplied but contradicting the sidecar / supplied with no sidecar (§3.5) | op-indexed hard error naming the expected value; write nothing |
| `record_id` matching no sidecar result while a persona is claimed (§3.5) | op-indexed hard error naming the sidecar's recordIds; write nothing |
| resolved/supplied `standard_place` country contradicts the place text (§3.6) | op-indexed hard error; write nothing |
| `resolveStandardPlace` network call fails | best-effort: leave `standard_place` unset, add a warning; never fail the op |
| Resulting documents fail `validateParsed` | write nothing (neither file); `{ ok: false, errors, opsReceived? }` |

---

## 9. Test plan (vitest)

- **append assigns max + 1 id** per section prefix; gap-tolerant (`a_001..a_003, a_009 → a_010`).
- **append validates** — a malformed assertion is rejected, nothing written.
- **update preserves id + supersede** — setting `superseded_by` on the old
  `person_evidence` entry while appending the new one; old entry never removed.
- **status transition** — question → `exhaustive_declared` rejected when
  `log_entry_ids` empty; accepted when satisfied; re-declare is a no-op.
- **conflict invariants** — fact conflict with <2 competing rejected; resolve
  without `weighing_analysis` rejected.
- **hypothesis** — `ruled_out` without reason rejected.
- **one-active-plan** — a second active plan for a question rejected.
- **plan_items** — appended into the right parent plan's `items`.
- **append-only enforced** — there is no delete op; an update never shrinks an array.
- **camelCase→snake_case** — persisted entry uses snake_case keys.
- **atomicity** — a validation failure leaves `research.json` byte-unchanged.
- **composite create** — `sourceDescription` writes the `S` entry (shared `nextId`
  allocator), stamps the sources op, echoes `sourceDescriptionId`, writes both
  files tree-first with a tree `.bak`.
- **reuse-or-create** — an existing `S` reference is accepted with the tree
  untouched; a dangling `S` and a neither/both call are rejected op-indexed.
- **source_id auto-stamp** — omitted/null `source_id` stamped in a single-source
  batch; explicit `source_id` wins; zero/2+ source batches stamp nothing.
- **D2 matrix** — sidecar auto-fill of `record_persona_id` + `record_id`
  canonicalization; contradiction errors naming expected values; no-sidecar +
  supplied persona rejected; absence never errors.
- **joint-write atomicity** — a research-side validation failure after the
  in-memory `S` creation leaves **both** files byte-unchanged, no `.bak`.
- **place levers** — sidecar copy preferred over geocoding; `resolvedPlaces`
  echo; country-contradiction rejected; `standard_place: null` opt-out honored;
  `opsReceived` echoed on batch failures.
- **source-reuse matrix (§3.4.1)** — all four paths: no match → `created`
  (S written, `sourceReuse` echoed); same repository → `updated_existing`
  (append converted to update, assertions stamped with the existing `src_`,
  no S created, research-only write, `sourceDescription` ignored); different
  repository → `new_source_reused_s` (new `src_` citing the first match's S,
  no S created); explicit `gedcomx_source_description_id` → today's semantics,
  no `sourceReuse`. Plus the multi-repo edge (two existing sources for the
  record — the repository-equal one is updated; a third repository reuses the
  FIRST match's S) and canonicalized `record_id` forms (resolver URL vs bare
  ARK vs type-prefixed id all match the same existing source).

## 10. Consumers / wiring

Standard MCP tool: `src/tools/research-append.ts`, schema in `allToolSchemas`,
dispatch in `src/index.ts`, name in `manifest.json` (packaging drift test enforces
parity). Reuses `atomicWriteJson` + `validateParsed`; share the per-prefix max-id
helper with `tree_edit`/the merge core (lift `maxIdNum` to a shared util).

Consumers — the skills whose hand-written section writes it replaces
(`record-extraction` reaches this machinery through `extraction_append`, §11,
not through `research_append` itself):
`record-extraction` (sources + assertions + classification field updates —
classification merged from the former assertion-classification skill,
2026-07-11), `person-evidence` (`pe_` links + supersede), `conflict-resolution`
(conflict append + resolve), `hypothesis-tracking`, `research-exhaustiveness`
(exhaustive_declaration), `question-selection`/`research-plan` (questions, plans,
plan-items), `proof-conclusion` (question resolution). Their SKILL.md rewrites are a
follow-up (companion to `skill-rewrites-for-persistence-tools-spec.md`), not part of
this tool's landing.

---

## 11. `extraction_append` — the lane-scoped variant

`extraction_append` is this tool restricted to the two sections the
`record-extractor` agent owns: **`sources` and `assertions`**. Same
implementation, same input surface, same validate-once/write-once semantics; the
other eleven sections are simply not reachable through it.

### 11.1 Why a second tool and not a parameter

In the birkeland re-run (`record-extraction-consolidation-closing-report.md`
§3.1) the router's delegation message instructed the extractor to write
`person_evidence` entries at `confident` — against the agent body's prose lane
rule — and the agent complied, fabricating a `0.92` `match_score` no tool had
computed.

Three ways to express a lane, and only one holds:

| Expression | Holds? |
|---|---|
| Prose in the agent body | **No** — a caller that prompts against it wins; this is the observed failure |
| A parameter on the tool input | **No** — the caller supplies the input, so it can widen its own lane |
| Tool identity | **Yes** — the agent's `tools:` frontmatter omits the broad writer, so there is no call it can emit |

The lane is therefore the *tool*, and the extractor's frontmatter omits
`research_append` and additionally names it in `disallowedTools` (a deny is
enforced even under `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"`, which the hosted path
runs; an omission alone is not).

**Enforcement evidence.** A subagent declared `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash`,
told its caller had authorized overriding its convention, then instructed to
call `Write` and `ToolSearch`, reported both as *absent from its toolset* rather
than rejected at call time — the control `Read` succeeded. Anthropic's subagent
docs extend this to MCP tools explicitly.

**Cowork enforces the mechanism, but our tool names do not currently bind there.**
Observed in a live Cowork session (2026-07-18): the `image-reader` subagent fails
because it "looks for `mcp__genealogy__image_transcribe` but the tool here is
named `mcp__remote-devices__Genealogy_Research__image_transcribe`". That failure
is itself the proof — if Cowork ignored `tools:`, the subagent would inherit the
session toolset, resolve the tool under its real name, and work. Only a
restrictive allow-list can be *broken* by a name that matches nothing. So the
denial mechanism this section depends on is real in Cowork.

**The naming has since been fixed (2026-07-18).** The prefix is
deployment-dependent: `mcp__genealogy__*` is the arbitrary `mcp_servers` dict
key the harnesses, `.mcp.json`, and the hosted web control plane chose, while
Cowork reaches the host-installed `.mcpb` through a remote-device *bridge* and
exposes it as `mcp__remote-devices__Genealogy_Research__*` (after
`manifest.json`'s `display_name`). No single spelling resolves everywhere, so
every agent now lists each MCP tool under **both** — in `tools:` and in
`disallowedTools:` alike. The latter matters most here: a deny naming only the
unresolvable spelling denies nothing, which would have left this section's
belt-and-braces layer inert in Cowork exactly where `bypassPermissions` makes
it load-bearing. Enforced by `tests/packaging/agent-tool-names.test.ts`.

With that in place, this section's guarantee holds in all four environments.
`CLAUDE.md`'s superseded claim that a single qualified spelling makes an agent
"behave identically" across them has been corrected accordingly. One residual
assumption is tracked in `docs/TODOs.md`: that the runtime refuses a spawn only
when *every* entry is unrecognized, rather than on any one of them.

### 11.2 The gate

Lane scoping is a **second function parameter** on `researchAppend`, never a
field on `ResearchAppendInput`:

```ts
researchAppend(input, { allowedSections, toolName })
```

Two properties follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **Unforgeable.** `index.ts` dispatches `researchAppend(args)` with a single
  argument built from `request.params.arguments`. An extra JSON key on the tool
  input lands on `input`, never on the options object. (Note that tool
  `inputSchema` `enum`s are *documentation*, not a gate — `index.ts` casts
  arguments and the MCP SDK validates only the request envelope.)
- **Visible to the eval harness.** `eval/harness/harness/mock_mcp.py` imports
  these exported functions directly and never routes through `index.ts`. A gate
  in the dispatch layer would be invisible to every eval run, so it lives in the
  module.

The check runs **after ops are resolved and before `prepareOps`**, which does
live Places-API resolution and mutates the tree in memory: a call that was always
going to be rejected must not burn network round-trips first.

### 11.3 Error contract

A lane rejection names **only** the calling tool and the sections it *does*
write:

```
section 'person_evidence' is not writable by extraction_append
(it writes only: sources, assertions). Another skill owns that section —
surface the finding in your summary instead.
```

It must **not** name the tool that would accept the section, nor enumerate the
denied sections. Either string is a routing map — precisely what a model needs to
work around the lane. (`applyOne`'s generic "not supported by research_append
(supported: …)" message is reached only for a genuinely unknown section under
`research_append` itself; the lane gate intercepts first for a scoped caller.)

Batch form prefixes the failing index as usual (`ops[1]: section '…' is not
writable by …`), and the batch stays all-or-nothing: nothing is written.

### 11.4 What this does *not* fix

The router (main thread) is unrestrained in production — e2e grants
`mcp__genealogy` wholesale and the hosted path runs `bypassPermissions` with no
allowlist — so nothing stops the *router* from writing `person_evidence` itself,
and there is precedent for a router doing directly what a subagent was denied
(`eval/harness/harness/context_policy.py` was built after the router was observed
calling `image_read` directly). The mitigation is prose in
`record-extraction/SKILL.md` forbidding delegations that order identity writes;
the instrument if it recurs is a `context_policy` PreToolUse rule keyed on
`agent_id`, which is eval-only.

`match_score` also remains fabricable by `person-evidence` itself. It is not
derivable at the tool boundary: `same_person`'s tree side is a hand-curated
"record-sized" slice, and a local stub returns a degenerate near-zero score the
skill must interpret as *no score*. The lever there is eval/rubric, not tooling.
