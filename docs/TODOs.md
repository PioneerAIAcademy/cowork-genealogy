# TODOs — hosted web workbench

Deferred items to revisit. Not blocking the alpha. Architecture context:
`docs/plan/realtime-rearch-status.md`.

## Pre-production
- [ ] **Delete-janitor** — GC E2B sandboxes for sessions idle > N days (cost).
  There is no in-session reaper (E2B's `on_timeout: pause` lifecycle is the idle
  backstop; C5 removed the in-CP idle loop). This is only for *abandoned*
  sessions: a background task / cron that lists sandboxes whose project
  `last_active` is older than N days and deletes them.
- [ ] **`ws_signing_key` prod guard** — it defaults to
  `dev-ws-signing-key-change-me` (`config.py`). Make the control plane refuse to
  start in prod (e.g. when `PUBLIC_URL` is https, or behind an explicit flag) if
  it's still the dev default, so a deploy can't silently mint forgeable
  per-sandbox WS tokens.

## Before horizontal scaling (`count > 1`)
- [ ] **`init_db` → Fly `release_command`** — move `init_db()` (`create_all()` +
  the allowlist seed) off the per-boot path into a one-time Fly `release_command`
  that runs once before any Machine starts. At `count > 1`, two Machines booting
  together race: both pass `create_all`'s existence check then both `CREATE TABLE`,
  and both see an allowlist email absent then both `INSERT` the same PK
  (`IntegrityError`) — crashing a boot. **Not needed at `count = 1`** (single
  always-on Machine; no concurrent boot — harmless). Required before
  `fly scale count > 1`. See `docs/plan/neon-postgres-plan.md` § "Also before
  count > 1". (The other former `count > 1` blockers are already cleared: the DB
  pin by the Neon migration, and the `LiveSession` pin by the shipped
  sandbox-as-server arch; the `/v1` turn lock is already DB-backed.)

## Depends on other work
- [ ] **Wiki page tools corpus** — `wiki_read` / `wiki_place_page` need the
  pre-crawled wiki markdown (`wikiMarkdownDir`). Being handled by baking the
  corpus into the `wiki-query-api` tool (not the sandbox image). Once that lands,
  point those tools at it (or move them to the networked API like `wiki_search`).
  Until then they error; everything else works.

## Done
- ~~`/v1` public REST chat API~~ — **shipped** (#294) as a control-plane
  WS-client to the in-sandbox server; bearer auth, sync + SSE, DB-backed turn
  lock. Spec: `docs/plan/public-rest-api.md`.
