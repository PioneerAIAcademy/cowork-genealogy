description: Use when the architect wants to answer the questions the board has queued for him — "make decisions", "what needs my ruling", "drain the decision queue", "answer the needs-decision items", or a bare "/make-decisions". Reads every open `needs-decision` issue, presents each as a question with its options and a recommendation, records the ruling on the issue, and removes the label so the next `/fill-ready` can rank and promote it. Run it daily; it is cheap by design. Do NOT use to choose what the team works on or to move anything on the board — that is `/fill-ready`, which promotes the items this skill unblocks. Do NOT use to hunt for structural bets — that is `/find-big-wins`. Never promotes, never starts the work.

# Make decisions

The `needs-decision` label is a queue of questions the board could not answer for
itself. `/triage-standup`, `/fill-ready` and `/review-ready` all fill it and run
daily. **This skill is the only thing that empties it.**

**Run this daily, and keep it cheap.** Most items arrive pre-prepared —
`/review-ready` writes the question, the options and its recommendation into the
body before labelling. Your job on those is to read, ask, and record. If you find
yourself sweeping the corpus, reading ADRs, or re-litigating whether the work is
worth doing, you have drifted into `/find-big-wins`. `/fill-ready` already ranked
these; the question is never "should we do this."

**Never move a card.** Removing the label is the whole delivery — the next
`/fill-ready` ranks the item in a junior pool and promotes it. Moving an item up
the board is `/fill-ready`'s job and never yours.

**`/find-big-wins` reads this queue but must never drain it.** A question that
keeps coming back is evidence for that skill that doctrine is missing. One
remover, or the two disagree about what is still open.

## 0. Two sweeps, first

```sh
# (a) ANSWERED — a ruling exists and the label is still on. This is your input,
# not a defect: rulings arrive at standup and in bare comments, through channels
# with no apply step. Close each one out in §3; the answer already exists, so it
# costs nothing. It IS a defect only for an item that was here last run too —
# that one survived a drain.
#
# `test` and not `startswith`: a real ruling comment carries a heading above the
# marker and a number after it, so an exact-prefix match reports zero forever.
# BOTH WORDS, BOTH MARKUPS — this reads what was written, not what we tell people
# to write: `**Ruling:**`, `## Decision:` and `**Decision (lead, <date>)` all
# occur. A `**Ruling`-only test missed two real rulings on 2026-08-13 (issues
# #1331, #1394). Here a miss is silent, because the query reports emptiness as
# health.
gh issue list --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --state open --limit 200 \
  --label needs-decision --json number,title,comments \
  -q '.[] | select([.comments[].body
                   | test("(?m)^#{1,4} +(Ruling|Decision)\\b|\\*\\*(Ruling|Decision)\\b")] | any)
      | "#\(.number)  \(.title)"'

# (b) LABELLED, no question written. Run this AFTER (a) and exclude (a)'s hits:
# an item with a recorded ruling is a half-applied close-out, not a missing
# question. Most of what remains is ordinary unprepared input from
# /triage-standup — prepare it in §2. It is a DEFECT only when the body says
# "Prepared by review-ready", because then the block was written and lost.
gh issue list --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --state open --limit 200 \
  --label needs-decision --json number,title,body \
  -q '.[] | select(.body | test("(?m)^#{1,4} +Decision needed\\b") | not)
      | "#\(.number)  \(.title)"'
```

Report each count as one line. Close out everything in (a) this run. Prepare (b)
in §2, and flag separately any whose body claims `review-ready` prepared it —
that block was written and then lost.

## 1. Read the queue

```sh
gh issue list --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --state open --limit 200 \
  --label needs-decision --json number,title,updatedAt,labels \
  -q '.[] | "\(.updatedAt[0:10])\t#\(.number)\t\(.title)"' | sort
```

**`senior` is not your queue.** Those are hard regardless of any open question
and go to a senior in the matching lane. Never carry both labels; `/fill-ready`
§ "Above the junior pools" owns the split.

## 2. Present each question

A pre-prepared item carries its own block; pass its **options** through
**verbatim** — header, question, options, recommended first. The `task-reviewer`
agent that wrote it read the spec, the ADRs and the code, and you did not. Do not
restate an option in your own words.

**But the block is the fork, not the briefing. Writing the briefing is your job,
and it is the job.** A prepared block opens mid-argument: it names options for a
problem it assumes you already understand, because the agent that wrote it had
just read the issue. He has not. Handing him labels and consequences with no setup
asks him to rule on a question he cannot see, and it is the single way this skill
most often wastes his turn — corrected five separate times.

**Before the fork, in your own message, write what he needs to decide it.** Not a
summary of the issue — the four things below, and stop:

1. **What the thing is, in plain words.** Assume he has not read the issue, the
   spec, or the code. Name what the file/skill/check actually does before naming
   what is wrong with it.
2. **What happens today, and how it was observed.** The measurement, the live case,
   the count — with the number, not "several".
3. **What is genuinely in dispute**, narrowed to the real fork. Often it is
   narrower than the issue's own framing: the useful question turned out to be
   "which of these two documents is wrong", not "what should the rule be".
4. **What each side costs and gives up** — the counter-argument rule below.

`AskUserQuestion`'s `description` field is far too short to carry any of this. It
goes in the prose of the message that makes the tool call, above it.

**Verify the block's load-bearing claims before you pass them on.** The prepared
options carry costs and blockers as fact, and a wrong one silently decides the
question. Check the ones the fork turns on — read the return type, run the count,
open the rubric. On 2026-08-27 this changed two of four asks: an option priced as
needing live API captures needed none, and a dimension's real dispute turned out to
be narrower than the issue stated.

```
## Decision needed — <header>

<question, one sentence>

- **A — <label>** — <consequence that decides it>  *(recommended)*
- **B — <label>** — <consequence>

<details><summary>Body text if A</summary>

<the issue-body text option A produces>

</details>

<details><summary>Body text if B</summary>

<the issue-body text option B produces>

</details>

*Prepared by review-ready YYYY-MM-DD.*
```

An item from `/triage-standup` arrives unprepared. Prepare it the same way before
asking: the question in one sentence, the options, the consequence that decides
each, and your recommendation. Usually one of four shapes — a doctrine call after
which the rest is mechanical; a spec that has to exist before the code does; a
design fork closable by a cheap probe; or a blast radius nobody has written down,
which is the one that most often disappears once written.

**If preparing one would take more than a few minutes of reading, stop.** Leave
it labelled and name it in the report — nobody else prepares it for you. One
expensive item must not turn the daily run into the weekly one. An item you have
deferred twice is not a question that needs preparing; relabel it `senior`.

**Give every alternative a pros AND cons, not just the recommended one.** A
recommendation with nothing said against it is not a decision he can make; it is
one he can only ratify — and an option listed with only its cost is not a real
alternative, it is a strawman. He has asked for this explicitly, twice in one
run, after being given option text that carried a consequence but no case in
favour.

Put them in a **table** — that is the shape that settled it both times. For two
options, a column each reads best:

```
| | **A — <label>** | **B — <label>** |
|---|---|---|
| **For** | <the strongest honest case FOR A> | <the strongest honest case FOR B> |
| **Against** | <what A costs or gives up> | <what B costs or gives up> |
```

For three or more, flip it — one row per option, `For` and `Against` as the two
columns — or the cells get too narrow to read.

Three rules for filling it in:

- **The "Against" cell for your recommended option must be real.** If you cannot
  write one, you have not understood the fork — go back and find it. On 2026-08-27
  the honest argument against the recommended option ("some criteria are premature
  by construction on this path") is the one that changed his answer.
- **The "For" cell for an option you are arguing against must be its strongest
  form**, not the version that is easy to dismiss.
- **State cost parity when it exists.** "Both options buy one paid eval run, so
  cost is not a tiebreaker" removes a whole axis he would otherwise weigh.

**Do not restate the same fact in both columns.** A table where every "Against"
is the mirror of the neighbouring "For" carries no information the option labels
did not already carry.

**Merge identical forks.** Two issues asking the same question get asked once as
policy — one question, two items unblocked.

`AskUserQuestion` takes four at a time; the rest go in prose. **Prefer fewer,
fully briefed, over four thin ones** — a batch he has to answer blind is worth
nothing, and he will send it back. Two properly set up beats four passed through.

## 3. Close it out in the same turn

**The moment he decides, apply it.** Four writes, in this order, before the next
item. An answer heard and not applied is worse than one never asked for.

```sh
# 1. the durable record — his answer, in his words, on the issue
gh issue comment <N> --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy \
  --body "**Ruling:** <his answer> — <the one-line reason, if he gave one>"

# 2. splice the chosen option's pre-written body text in, replacing the whole
#    `## Decision needed` block, so the next reader gets the decision and not the
#    open fork. Copy it — do not compose your own; you did not do the reading.
#    An item you prepared yourself in §2 has no pre-written option text and no
#    block to replace: write the decision and the alternative it beat into the
#    body directly. You did the reading this run, so you are the one who can.
#    Edit body.md with `python3 - <<'PY'` (the body carries backticks and
#    markdown that a shell heredoc will mangle):
#    gh issue view <N> --json body -q .body > body.md, edit, then:
gh issue edit <N> --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --body-file body.md

# 3. if the body carries a reviewed marker, refresh its clause in the same edit:
#    > **Reviewed <date> before junior handoff.** Decision recorded below; ...
#    Reader hygiene only — the `reviewed` LABEL is what `/fill-ready` skips on,
#    and a recorded ruling does not void it. Never write a marker onto an issue
#    that was never reviewed: that forges a review and wins a permanent skip.

# 4. the label comes off, and the item ranks in a junior pool like anything else
gh issue edit <N> --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --remove-label needs-decision
```

The `**Ruling:**` comment is the record, not a queue. It exists so the next
reader — a junior picking the issue up, `/audit-board`, a later run of this skill
— sees the decision and its reasoning.

## 4. Answers that are not a choice between the options

- **"Neither — the real question is X."** Rewrite the `## Decision needed` block
  with the corrected question and **leave the label on**. It comes back next run.
- **He picked against the recommendation, on an option the block flags as
  changing the blast radius.** Do not splice — re-run one `task-reviewer` on that
  issue alone, telling it the decision, and use what comes back. The site list was
  computed under a different assumption.
- **He answered something no option covered.** Same: re-run one agent with his
  answer rather than guessing at the body text.
- **He answered with a question rather than a choice.** Answer it, then re-ask.
  This is the most common non-choice and it is not a stall — it means a fact the
  options asserted is one he does not believe, or one they left out. **Go and
  check it in the repo; do not answer from the issue body.** On 2026-08-27 five
  answers in one run were questions, and checking each changed the outcome: the
  MCP server turned out to be one process per session (which made a whole option
  unnecessary), a tool assumed to be an API passthrough turned out to compute its
  own results (which reframed the card), and a proposed logging destination turned
  out not to exist. Twice the honest answer was "you are right, and here is the
  part that does not work" — say both halves.
- **"This is hard either way."** Swap `needs-decision` for `senior`. Never both.
- **"Don't do this."** Close it: `gh issue close <N> --repo PioneerAIAcademy/cowork-genealogy --reason
  "not planned" --comment "<why>"`. The label goes with the issue.

## 5. Report

Short. Five lines and a list.

- The two sweep counts. For (a), flag anything that was also there last run.
  For (b), name the skill that dropped it.
- How many items were open at the start, and how many you closed out.
- Anything answered as `senior` or closed, one line each.
- Any question you had to prepare because it arrived unprepared.
- Items left waiting, oldest first, with their time in queue — measured from when
  the label went on, not from when the issue was filed. The two are unrelated:
  issue #607 was 48 days old and one day into the queue.

**A question that reaches you for the third time is not a decision.** Say so in
the report — it is doctrine nobody has written down, and it belongs to
`/find-big-wins` as a proposal, not here as a recurring ask.
